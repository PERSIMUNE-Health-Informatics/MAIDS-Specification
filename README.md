# Specification for the Medical AI Datasheet (MAIDS)
A versioned specification for the Medical AI Datasheet project.

*v0.1-alpha*

MAIDS is currently being prototyped for the [Copenhagen Ultrathon on Precision Medicine](https://ultrathon.online) where you will find several examples.

This repository is intended to maintain the specification for what a MAIDS document is, what it is meant to be, and best practices. The code for implementing the specification is [maintained separately](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE-Health-Informatics/MAIDS).

MAIDS is inspired by the work of [Gebru et al., 2020, in "Datasheets for datasets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) and is intended to expand on it as a tool for data communication in medicine.
